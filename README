Problem 1 is answered in the CHEME5440HW2.m file. This code asks you what you want to plot and has special inputs. All plots are in
Appendix A of the PDF. Input a string for each variable following this key:
Elongation Rate = 'kEj'
Gene Concentration = 'Gj_'
RNAP Concentration = 'RXT'
Rate of Closed Complex Formation = 'kmi'
rate of Closed Complex Dissociation = 'kpl'
rate of Open Complex Formation = 'kI_'
Saturation Constant of Gene and RNAP = 'KXj'
Time Constant of Gene and RNAP = 'tau'
Weight for RNAP Binding = 'W1_'
Weight for RNAP and INducer Binding = 'W2_'
Cooperativity Constant = 'n__'
Inducer Saturation Constant = 'K__'
Rate of mRNA Degration = 'kd_'
Specific Growth Rate of E. Coli (Dilution) = 'mu_'
Voigt Saturation Kinetic Term = 'fI_'


Problem 2B is answered with HW2Run.m that calls the function CHEME5440HW2B.m. Note that the value for W_23 must be changed manually in
CHEME5440HW2B.m to get the broken circuit.

Problem 2C is answered with CHEME5440HW2C.m and calls the function f.m. Note that the value for W_23 must be changed manually in
CHEME5440HW2C.m to get the broken circuit. The legend has extra inputs because of the desire to include both plots overlayed on each 
other.
